# JavaScript Loose Typing Bug

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in JavaScript related to the loose typing of the + operator.  The bug arises from the unexpected behavior of the + operator when used with different data types, specifically numbers and strings, and when handling null and undefined values.

## Bug Description

The `+` operator in JavaScript exhibits inconsistent behavior depending on the types of its operands. When one operand is a string and the other is a number, it performs string concatenation instead of numerical addition. This can lead to unexpected results and logic errors in programs.

Further inconsistencies arise when using null or undefined values with the + operator. This can result in NaN (Not a Number) or other unexpected behavior.

## Solution

The solution involves using stricter type checking and explicit type conversion to avoid unexpected behavior.  Using TypeScript or adding explicit type checks within the JavaScript code ensures that the + operator functions as expected for numerical addition.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run the code in `bug.js`. Observe the unexpected outputs.
3. Review the solution in `bugSolution.js` to see how to mitigate the bug.
